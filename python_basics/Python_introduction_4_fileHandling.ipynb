The `with` statement provides a way to wrap the use of a resource with a block of code, ensuring that the resource is automatically cleaned up even if an exception is raised.\n",

The `__enter__` method is called when the block of code is entered, and it returns the resource to be used in the block. The `__exit__` method is called when the block is exited, and it is responsible for cleaning up the resource."
