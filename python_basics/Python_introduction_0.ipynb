    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles or software design philosophies for writing computer programs in Python (it was intended to have 20 aphorisms, only 19 have been written down). It was written by Tim Peters, a prominent Python developer. These principles emphasize simplicity, readability, and elegance in code. \n",

    "They are included in the PEP 20 â€“ The Zen of Python. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community. [PEP 20 here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)  \n",

    "* PEP 20: The Zen of Python. This PEP outlines the guiding principles of the Python language and its community, including simplicity, readability, and the importance of practicality over purity.\n",
    "* PEP 257: Docstring Conventions. This PEP provides guidelines for writing documentation strings (docstrings) that describe the purpose, usage, and behavior of Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.\n",
    "* PEP 484: Type Hints. This PEP introduces a syntax for adding optional type hints to Python code, which can be used by static type checkers to catch common errors before code is run.\n",
    "* PEP 3101: Advanced String Formatting. This PEP introduces a powerful new syntax for formatting strings in Python, which makes it easier to write complex output such as tables, reports, and emails.\n",
    "* PEP 498: Literal String Interpolation. This PEP introduces a simpler syntax for formatting strings in Python, which allows expressions to be embedded directly in string literals using a new f-string syntax.\n",
    "* PEP 572: Assignment Expressions. This PEP introduces a new syntax for assigning a value to a variable as part of a larger expression, which makes it easier to write concise, readable code in some situations.\n",
    "* PEP 3107: Function Annotations. This PEP introduces a syntax for adding optional annotations to Python function signatures, which can be used to document the expected types of arguments and return values, as well as for other purposes such as automatic API generation and debugging.  \n",

This tool is very versatile, because it allows to separate the code in cells and add documentation or report elements to make a perfect documentation. It also allows to add elements in markdown typing and html format, so it becomes a powerful tool to insert formatted text, images and graphics."

    "\n",
    "1. They must start with an underscore (_) or some letter.\n",

    "3. They can be of any length\n",

    "# Python Variables  \n",
    "Python has several types of variables natively. Starting with numeric variables, Python can work with integers, floating numbers and complex numbers. It also has strings to work with text and another type of variables called booleans to store binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we declare variables is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`variable_name = <value>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of a variable cannot have spaces, it must start with a letter, it can contain capital letters or numbers inside the name.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dog = \"Nova\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also keep in mind that in python **everything** is an object, even elements such as integers, floats and other *variables* so all identifiers are actually references to objects that contain the value among other attributes and methods.  \n",
